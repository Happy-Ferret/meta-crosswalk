This recipe provides a package for the Chromium web browser. It strives to
always follow the latest stable Linux release as listed in
https://omahaproxy.appspot.com

We refer to the web browser as Chromium, not Chrome, because "Chrome" is
Google's version of the web browser with proprietary content on top of the
open-source Chromium browser.

Since Chromium 58.0.3029.81, there is a build-time dependency on nodejs, which
is run on the host to preprocess a few files. This recipe has been tested with
the nodejs recipe from https://github.com/ostroproject/meta-iot-web.

Compared to a usual, smaller recipe, the Chromium recipe has a few
peculiarities:
- The Chromium binary is built without debug symbols on 32-bit target
  architectures, as the generated binary gets too large for the information to
  be properly contained in the ELF32 headers of the binary.
- We manually patch parts of the build system to replace Chromium's bundled
  copies of some packages (flac, libjpeg and others) with system-wide ones.
- Parts of the V8 (Chromium's JavaScript engine) build need to run binaries
  built for the target, for which we use QEMU.

The "proprietary-codecs" PACKAGECONFIG option builds Chromium with support for
non-free multimedia codecs, such as H.264 and others. It is your responsibility
to make sure you are complying with the codecs' licensing terms.

The "root-profile" PACKAGECONFIG adds a small patch to the Chromium binary
wrapper that allows the web browser to run as root without the need to use the
--user-data-dir command-line option.
Its only purpose is to aid testing and debugging when adding Chromium to an
image such as core-image-sato, where root is the only user by default.
This option (which is disabled by default) is NOT RECOMMENDED in production.
